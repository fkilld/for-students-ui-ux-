			Unfortunately, no crow had joined yet, but they could not wait any longer. <br>
			They debated, "Garuda, who is the king of all birds, is always busy in <br>
			serving his master. He has neither the time, nor the interest to bother <br>
			about us! There is no point in having a king who does not protect and <br>
			remains at the position of the king only as a namesake." <br>
			And so the birds discussed, "Let us choose a king amongst us!" <br>
			On this, they started looking at each other; <br>
			suddenly the features of owl attracted everybody.<br> 
			He was powerful, had impressive features, and most importantly he <br>
			could see at night, when they were most unsafe. <br>

			With a map of all the continents and oceans drawn, <br>
