# How the Web works

### The Internet
- A global network of computers

- Each computer/router has a ***IP Address*** e.g. 73.158.6.61 to uniquely identify itself. Think of this like your physical home address. The IP Address is assigned to you by your Internet Provider.
  - Within a single network (for example your home network), each device has their own ***local*** IP address and these addresses are private. Only the IP address of the router is public.
- Computers talk to each other using the ***TCP/IP Protocol***
- ***HTTP*** (HyperText Transfer Protocol) or ***HTTPS*** (HTTP with Secure connection using an SSL Certificate) handles web traffic (requests/responses) between web browsers and servers.
  - The servers send back HTML and other necessary files to the browsers to display to the users. 

### Web Servers
- ***Websites/Webpages*** are files stored on computers that run a piece of software called a ***web server*** (for example Apache, Nginx, etc.)
  
- ***Hosting companies*** provide space on a server for your website
- ***Domain names*** can be purchased from registrars and linked to your hosting account/web server
- ***DNS*** (Domain Name Service) is used to map IP Addresses to domain names so we don't have to remember the IP Addresses.

# The Roles of HTML and CSS in Web Development

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
- is ***NOT*** a programming language

- HTML is purely visual and no logics involved, a markup for creating webpages/documents
- is extremely important and relevant but also only a beginning

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- Styling/Stylesheet Language. ***NOT*** an actual programming language because also no logics, just visual only

- Used for styling HTML elements
- Can be extended with Sass/Less
  
### HTML handles the contents and CSS handles the stylings of those contents

### Roles of Web Technologies
- HTML: Content display/Structure

- CSS: Style & Design
- JavaScript: Dynamic Front End Programming
- PHP, Python, C#, JS: Backend Programming
- MySQL, MongoDB: Database/Storage

### What can HTML & CSS do?
- Build static websites (still, no interactions)

- Build the ***visual*** part of anything
