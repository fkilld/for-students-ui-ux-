# Tag Syntax
- Tags are elements surrounded in angle brackets

- Usually there are start `<...>` and end `</...>` tags
- Some tags close themselves (Remnant of XHTML).
  -  `<br>`: valid in HTML5
  -  `<br />`: valid in HTML5 and XHTML

### ***Note:*** The HTML file called "index", by convention, is the homepage of any websites.

# Emmet
- A HTML code suggestion and generation tool embedded in VSCode

- Some special syntaxes:
  - `!`: Generates the basic HTML structure
  - `lorem[number]`: Generates dummy text consisting of [number] word(s). 

# `meta` tags
- meta for meta data. 

- Describe some attributes of the webpage. Don't actually display anything visually.

# HTML Block vs Inline elements
- A ***block*** level element spans 100% the width of the page. Therefore, the element that comes after a block element has to go to the next line.
- An ***inline*** level element ***DOES NOT*** span the whole width of the page but just as much as it needs. Hence, the element coming after an inline element does not have to go to the next line if it can fit to the right in the remaining width.
